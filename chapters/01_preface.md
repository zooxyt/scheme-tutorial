Preface
=======

One of the greatest innovations in the past century is computer, it 
was original designed for science computing and used for rare people
in research facilities from the beginning, but now spreads into every
corner in our daily life. Even people with little experience with 
computers know click some buttons and install the applications they want
to solve the problem in real world or to do some entertainment.

I was heavily afraid of touching such machines when I was in early age
cause computers are pretty expensive and I'm afraid of if broke it down.
But one day, I became deeply into it, the turning point was programming.

Programming makes people freely control the machine and schedule things 
for it to make it solving problems automatically, just 
like placing dominoes in appropriate positions and push the first
one to see the how dominoes falling down one by one automatically. 
To release the power of computer and to command it working in the willing
of people, programming is essential. 

The tutorial is about programming for absolute beginners, with
a programming language named "Scheme".


Specification
-------------

The latest fully (at the time of this tutorial been written) 
published specification of Scheme Programming Language could be 
R6RS, which is short for 
**The Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on the Algorithmic Langauge**
and could be viewed at: 
http://www.r6rs.org/ 

The specification contains 4 parts including Libraries and so on, 
makes Scheme bias the original simple design, 
so the tutorial covers a previous version, 
R5RS and could be downloaded at:
http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/
The document is pretty short, only contains 50 pages 
(as a specification of a programming language
 compares to other programming languages 
 such as C++ which contains more than 1000 pages).
