Expression

Of course evaluates some basic types and get those basic types return
is useless, for doing more things in Scheme, we need to write more complex
programs. The body of a program is called source code which means it is
the source where the final `program` that machine understand comes from.
  
Contrast to the so-called rich text which contains formats, the most
classic source code of Scheme programs contains only plain text as the 
examples given in the previous chapters. In the perspective of `Syntax` 
we say the source code are basically consists of `s-expression` which
is short for "Symbolic Expressio".

An s-expression has two derieved forms:
- Atom
- Pair
